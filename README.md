# Udacity MOOC Notes

Sometimes I spend some time learning or relearning things.  Sometimes with
MOOCS. I would guess that nothing here is useful to anyone else. But that's how
it goes.

If anything here is miraculously useful, think of everything being permissively
licensed. Consider code with the MIT Licence (though really there are certainly
better implementations of everything elsewhere), and any notes that I've written
as CC-BY (though these may be indecipherable to anyone else).
